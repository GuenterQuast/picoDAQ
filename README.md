*python* Data AcQuisition and analysis with PicoScope usb-oscilloscopes

The *usb*-oscilloscope series PicoSpope by Pico Technology 
(see https://www.picotech.com)
offers universal instruments that come with great software support, not only a graphical interface offering the functionality known from oscilloscopes, 
but - most importantly for this project - also with a software development kit
(*SDK*) which makes it possible to use the devices with a wide range of
high-level languages. 

Provided here is a data acquisition system as is needed to record, 
analyze, classify and count the occurrence of wave forms such as provided 
for example by single-photon counters or typical detectors common in 
quantum mechanical measurements or in nuclear, particle physics and astro
particle physics, e.g. photo tubes, Geiger counters, avalanche photo-diodes
or modern SiPMs.

The random nature of such processes and the need to keep read-out dead 
times low requires an input buffer and a buffer manager running as a 
background process. Data are provided via the buffer manager 
interface to several consumer processes to analyze, check or visualize 
data and analysis results. Such consumers may be obligatory ones, 
i. e. data acquisition pauses if all input buffers are full and an 
obligatory consumer is still busy processing. A second type of random 
consumers receives an event copy from the buffer manager upon request, 
without pausing the data acquisition process. Typical examples of 
random consumers are displays of a subset of the wave forms or of 
intermediate analysis results. Examples for such consumers are provided
as part of this package, running either as a 'thread' within the python
interpreter or as sub-processes using the 'multiprocessing' package.

This project originated as a demonstration to analyze pulses from a 
photomultiplier (PM) or a Silicon Photo Multiplier (SiPM) registering
optical signals from  a detector, in the simplest case a coffeepot
filled with water and equipped with a PM to count muons from cosmic rays. 

## List of implemented **Functions**:

   class *picoConfig*:

   - set up PicoScope channel ranges and trigger
   - set up the internal signal generator
   - PicoScope configuration read from *json* or *yaml* file
   - data acquisition of raw data from device

  class *BufferMan*:

   - acquire data (implemented as background thread)
   - manage event data buffer and distribute to consumers
   - configutation read from *json* or *yaml* file

      *obligatory* consumers: data acquisition pauses until consumer done

      *random* consumers: receive a copy of one event, data acquisition 
      continues

  module *AnimatedInstruments* (deprecated, to be removed soon)

   - examples of animated graphical devices: a Buffer Manager display
        (using class *plotBufManInfo), a VoltMeter (class *VoltMeter*),
         an Oscilloscope (class *Ocscilloscope* and a ratemeter
         (class *RMeter*). The module must run as a *python* *thread* in
         the same *python* interpreter as *BufferMan*

  module *mpLogWin* 

   - receives information from the Buffer Manager via a multiprocessing 
        Queue and displays Buffer Manager logging information in a text window 

  module *mpBufManInfo*

   - this sub-process receives status information from the Buffer Manager  
        via a multiprocessing Queue and displays input rate history, filling  
        level of the buffers and the data-acquisition lifetime 

  module *mpOsci*

   - runs an instance of *Oscilloscpe* as a sub-process, and receives
        data from *BufferMan* via a multiprocessing Queue.

  module *mpRMeter* 

   - runs an instance of the *RMeter* class as a sub-process, receiving
        via a multiprocessing Queue.

  module *mpVMeter* 

   - runs an instance of the *VoltMeter* class as a sub-process, receiving
        data via a multiprocessing Queue.

  module *mpHists* 
 
  - runs an instance of the *animHists* class as a sub-process; receives 
       input data via a multiprocessing Queue. Data are formatted as lists 
       of values. A normalized frequency distribution is then updated and 
       displayed.

  module *mpBDisplay* 

  - runs an instance of class BarDisplay and shows one (signed or unsigned)
       value per Channel (e.g. peak Voltage, effective Voltage etc.). Values 
       are passed to the sub-process via a multiprocessing Queue.

The script *runDAQ.py* gives an example of how to use all of the above. For a full demo, connect the output of a PicoScope's signal generator to channel *B*, and eventually an open cable to Channel *A* to see random noise. Use the configuration file *DAQconfig.json*, which contains the configuration files *BMconfig.json* for the Buffer Manager and *PSConfig.json* for the PicoScope. As a hook for own extensions, own python code may be included. An example for this is the configuration *DAQ_Cosmo.json*, which includes a code snippet *anaDAQ.py* to start a dedicated consumer for signal filtering and analysis (see *pulseFilter* below for another example). 

The consumer *pulseFilter.py* is an implementation of a convolution filter to search for characteristic signal shapes in an input waveform. The present example is tailored to identify short pulses from muon detectors. In first step, the trigger is validated by cross-correlation with a signal template. Coincidences around the time of the trigger signal are identified an all connected channels. The thirst step consists of a searches for additional pulses after the triggering event, indicating the decay of a stopped muon in or near the detector. This simple set-up allows to measure the mean muon lifetime in the muon rest frame (2.2 Âµs). 


## Installation of the package

This python code is compatible with *python* versions 2.7 and 3.5.
**Requirements:**

  - The low-level drivers and C-libraries contained in the Pico Technology
    Software Development Kit are required,  *SDK* by Pico Technology,
    see  https://www.picotech.com/downloads
  - *python* bindings of the *pico-python* project by Colin O'Flynn
    and Mark Harfouche, https://github.com/colinoflynn/pico-python

Graphical displays are implemented with *matplotlib*.

The code was tested with PicoScope device classes PS2000, PS2000a,   
PS3000a and PS4000 under Ubuntu, openSUSE Leap and on RaspberryPi

*picoDAQ* presently consists of the modules in the direcoctry *picodaqa*, mentioned above, and an example *python* script (*runDAQ.py*) with configuration examples (*.json* files) for the data acquisition (*DAQconfig.json*), for the PicoScope Device (*PSconfig.json*) and for the Buffer Mananger (*BMconfig.json*).

After downloading, connect your PicoScope and start from the command line, e. g. `python runDAQ.py`.
